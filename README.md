//////REPLACE THESE LATER

Submit a README.txt together with your code.  
The readme should be plain ASCII text and MUST contain information on how to compile your code. 
It MUST contain information on how to run your code and give examples.  
It should also have some words on how you expect the other groups to use your code.  
Remember that while you all standardised the protocol, others might have different ideas on how to approach the implementation, 
and you want to make it as easy for others to understand your code.
